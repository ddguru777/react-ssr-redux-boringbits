    Mainly because boring requires all traffic to come
    through from browsers using HTTPS protocol, as
    well as using a real domain (not localhost).

${chalk.yellow.bold(`Why take such a hard stance on this?`)}
    Core members of boring strongly believe developing
    in an environment as close to production as possible
    will create the most stable and secure code.
    Discussion around this topic welcome, please open

    Boring ships with HAProxy, you only need to have
    docker installed on your machine.  We have tested
    this setup for both mac and windows (via WSL).
