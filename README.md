# boring

A web framework that just works.  React based, universial by default, takes care of webpack and bablfying your code base out of the box.

This is heavily inspired by CRA and next.js.  Why not use those?  If you like them you should!  Boring is much more opinionated than both of these projects and will always place developer productivity over flexibity.
